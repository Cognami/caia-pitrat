Jacques Pitrat was the French pioneer of Artificial Intelligence.
His blog is (in Q1 2020) still available on http://bootstrappingartificialintelligence.fr/WordPress3/

His book [*Artificial Intelligence: the conscience of a conscious machine*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470611791) (2009 Wiley ISTE; Print ISBN:9781848211018)  describes in great detail the design of CAIA.

The [RefPerSys](http://refpersys.org/) system is inspired by CAIA.
